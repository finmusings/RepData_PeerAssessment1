## Loading and preprocessing the data
csv file has been unzipped into assignment root directory

Read into data table:
```{r}
fit_table<-read.csv("activity.csv")
head(fit_table)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Read the instructions carefully!  
I think I have what is requested now.  Add documentation!!


```{r}
total_steps <- by(fit_table$steps,fit_table$date,sum,na.rm=TRUE)
hist(total_steps,breaks=20)
mean(total_steps)
median(total_steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
